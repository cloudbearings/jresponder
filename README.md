## An email autoresponder written in Java

# Introduction

JResponder is a relatively simple autoresponder email system.  Meaning you hook it up to your website so people subscribe to your mailing list and they are automatically sent a series of emails at particularly chosen intervals.

Samples showing how to rapidly integrate JResponder into your website (using JQuery to call simple JSON web services), a robust (or at least getting more robust as we go along here) sending engine, and a very simple database schema with support for a zero-configuration embedded database or MySQL (or other DBMS supported by Hibernate) provide a workable email autoresponder system that you can use as-is or customize as you see fit.

A standalone download bundles this project with Apache Tomcat, to make a version that runs "out of the box".  JResponder is also easy to customize if you're a Java developer.

# Project Status

JResponder is very young.  Aside from "in-development", the overall status of this project is definitely EXPERIMENTAL.

The first JResponder builds and source tree were recently pushed to github, work is in progress on stabling it so we can have an official 0.1 release.
