<title>JResponder - An auto-responder system written in Java</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
JResponder was written to be a simple yet powerful system to automatically
send email responses to your mailing list(s).

<p>
This project is based on common enterprise-class frameworks - Spring and
Hibernate being the most notable.

<p>
Key features include:
<ul>
<li>Standalone version gets you up and running in minutes with an embedded
(H2) database, and.
<li>Built on common enterprise-class technologies like Spring and Hibernate.
Should be familiar to many Java developers.
<li>API is built with a moderate amount of extension feasible.  I say moderate
because while the project is overall decently structured, a few things were
done leaning toward simplicity instead of extensibility.  Minor additions
should be simple and easy to implement.  Major changes like using a different
language (other than Velocity) for messages, or using messages from a
database rather than on disk - those types of changes, while possible, were
not really the goal of this project.  Instead I've tried to make sure the
most common types of extensions would be easy, and keep the system overall
simple and easy to run and configure.
<li>Shoudl scale to hundreds of thousands of subscribers (possibly millions,
has not been fully tested as of this writing).
<li>Standalone (bundled with Tomcat) and WebApp (.war) builds available.
<li>Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
</ul>

<p>
See the package descriptions to get an idea of the different pieces of
the JResponder project.
<p>
The standalone conf/jresponder.xml file is a Spring XML file.  That is
also a good place to look to get an idea of some of the key components
and integration points (especially the configurable ones) of the system.
